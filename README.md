# Python3 Notes:

- This is my reference sheet for python. It contains some examples, helpful functions and general information.
The md file is best for reference in a browser while the pdf is best to download.

- There is also a reference sheet for VS Code shortcuts and packages for creating tables.

- For information on using Tkinter on Mac see [tkinter-mac](https://github.com/admiralGeneralCP5/tkinter-mac) repo.


>You may take these notes and modify them. If you want to convert a md file to a pdf and get the same results, use Joplin.
