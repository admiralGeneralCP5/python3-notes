# Python3 Notes:

This is my reference sheet for python. It contains some examples, helpful functions and general information.
The md file is best for reference in a browser while the pdf is best to download.

You may take these notes and modify them. If you want to convert a md file to a pdf and get the same results, use Joplin.
